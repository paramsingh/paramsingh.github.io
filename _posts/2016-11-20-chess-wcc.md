title: World Chess Championship
---

The World Chess Championship is going on, and it is so much fun.
Magnus Carlsen, the champion and the clear favorite according to FIDE ratings,
is facing off against Sergey Karjakin. I started off supporting Carlsen
(mainly because I hadn't heard of Karjakin much) but after watching the last
few games I can't help but root for the underdog. If Karjakin is able to get a win,
the whole chess community would be shocked and that would be awesome to see.

The last 6 games of the match have been draws but the matches weren't without fireworks.
I looked at some extremely complex positions and lines that I could never think of in my
lifetime. It has been really fun to watch and try to predict which move will be played next.
I'm not good at all but it's still really fun. One small regret I have is not following Chess
when Vishy Anand was the World Champion because then I'd have someone I'd support no matter what.

Here's hoping for 6 more great games (and maybe some great rapid games too!)
