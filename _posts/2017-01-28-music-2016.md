I've been meaning to do a post listing the albums I considered the best of 2016. Here's the ones I loved.

## Radiohead - A Moon Shaped Pool

Radiohead's return with LP9 started with the release of Burn The Witch, which is one of their best songs ever, in my opinion. The album also starts off with Burn The Witch and just never lets you down. Every song from start to finish is awesome.

**Favorite Tracks**: Burn The Witch, Identikit, The Numbers

## Kanye West - The Life of Pablo

My most anticipated release of 2016 was Kanye's new album. The run up to its release was weird with more than
one version of the album being released at the end, but as soon as you realize the genius of songs like Ultralight Beam and FML, you forgive Kanye for everything. I don't think that The Life of Pablo is as good as My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, or even Yeezus, but it is still really good.

**Favorite tracks**: Ultralight Beam, FML, Fade, No More Parties in LA

## Chance the Rapper - Coloring Book

I didn't really think much of Chance the Rapper when I heard Acid Rap for the first time, but his verse in Ultralight
Beam made me really want to listen to Coloring Book. And it didn't disappoint. The fun feel that you get from All Night and Problem are standouts in this album to me. The gospel influences are cool and all, but not really my thing, I guess.

**Favorite tracks**: Mixtape, Juke Jam, All Night

## James Blake - The Colour in Anything

This was the best Electronic album of 2016 for me. The vibes it gives is similar to A Moon Shaped Pool but it is
longer and has a killer cameo by Justin Vernon.

**Favorite Tracks**: Put that away and talk to me, I Need A Forest Fire

## Kendrick Lamar - untitled unmastered.

I would never have thought that Kendrick would even think of releasing anything after the instant classic that he
released in 2015, but the surprise drop of untitled unmastered, containing unreleased tracks of songs that he'd
previously performed live was an experience to behold for me.

**Favorite Tracks**: untitled 03, untitled 07 (levitate)
