My Google Summer of Code [proposal](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6609129159262208) for
"Adding Statistics and Graphs to ListenBrainz" was accepted by the
awesome people at Metabrainz Foundation Inc. last night! This is a really amazing thing for me, because
I love music and data related to it, and getting paid to hack on such an interesting project at the
intersection of music and technology over the summer is awesome.

I will also get to learn lots of cool new stuff and work with cool tech like d3.js and Google BigQuery.
My mentor is Robert Kaye (ruaok) who has been helping me work on ListenBrainz ever since I started in January. I'm hoping to get a good and early start on the project as soon as my exams end this week.

I'll follow up with more posts about my project over the summer, hopefully with interesting things to report! Here's to an awesome summer!
