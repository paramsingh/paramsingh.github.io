title: Why you're not dumb
---

Hi!

I decided to write a blog on feelings of negativity that I've seen a lot of us in
the tech world face over the small time I've been here.

I've personally struggled with feelings of incompetency a lot in the past few years.
I was a bit too into the competitive programming world and it is cut-throat. I used
to go into bouts of self-loathing if I didn't do as well as I thought I should have.
It made it hard to actually spend time having an actual life outside of programming.
I don't regret doing so much competitive coding at all, it is part of what made me who I am and
is definitely something I would do again. But I would definitely not care as much about it.

The feelings of incompetency have reduced a lot since the last year. I've been making efforts
to seperate my feelings of self-worth from the unending ladder of accomplishments
or from failure. A very chill friend of mine (who drinks a lot :P)
helped me do this (probably unknowingly) last year. I'm really thankful for that
because I've had code I wrote break in such ways this year, that if I was the same
person I was three years ago, I'd probably just wallow in self-loathing for a
few months.

I've realized now that part of it was
[Impostor Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome).
Do you ever get the nagging feeling that you're too dumb?
That people praising you just don't
know the real you yet and they'll find out that you've been faking it soon? That your
accomplishments weren't actually anything worthy of praise?
If you said "yes" to any of those questions, you're not alone.
Almost everyone gets the feeling sometime.

> "The assignment I made was so naive, why did they even select me for the interview?"

> "I can't give a good presentation to save my life."

> "I'm so dumb, I took a holiday and now I most definitely won't meet my deadline even
> though I've been working overtime these days."

These are three snippets of real conversations I've had with three really close friends
in the last month. They are all blatantly untrue statements, but I'm pretty sure they're
all saying it sincerely. Impostor Syndrome is definitely real and it's very widespread.

So how do we get over this?

In my opinion, the biggest thing to realize is that __YOU'RE A WORK IN PROGRESS__. Holding
yourself to impossible standards is a recipe for disaster, because no one
can realistically meet them. It's okay if you messed up a test, it's okay if
you cost your boss a week of extra work because of shit code, it's okay if
something did not go your way. It happens.
The important thing to glean from such stuff is not how dumb or incompetent you
are. The important thing to do is think about how or what you could improve
and move forward. Note that this having too much
self-confidence can be bad for you as well, but having too little of it is
generally a much bigger problem.

I know it's hard to push negativity away, but once you realize that the feelings
of negativity are unfounded or that everyone gets them, no matter how competent
or skilled or accomplished they are, it gets a bit easier. So, the next time you
feel like a fake or a dumbass, read this blog and remember that 58% of people
in the tech world think of themselves as impostors and that it's very probable
that you're one of them.

And try not to be too hard on yourself. :)
