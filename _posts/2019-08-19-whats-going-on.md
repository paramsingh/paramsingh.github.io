title: What's going on?
---

_"What'd you do last year?" and other questions no one ever really asks themselves, but they should._

# Where have you been?
So a lot of things have happened since my last post. I've graduated (that was a slog!),
I've joined [Stripe](https://stripe.com), I've moved countries. It's been easier than I thought it'd be,
though.

# What are you doing these days?
I'm writing code while standing at a desk everyday, which I've found can be pretty
good for my productivity. I'm also trying to eat at as many different restaurants as possible.

# Have you sold out? (more positive take: Would 17 year old you be proud?)
One thing that I've realised (although I probably already knew this)
is that writing code for
a billion dollar corporation is definitely not as fulfilling as working with MetaBrainz
as a bunch of upstart hippies trying to change the music industry. I'm pretty sure right now
that a few years down the road, I'm gonna look at [MetaBrainz](https://metabrainz.org) as the shining light in my work, so
I really am trying to find time for it as much as possible.

However, the decision to move has definitely not been the wrong one, as far as I can see right now.
I'm learning new things, meeting more and more intelligent people pretty much every day, to say
nothing of the feeling of seeing a new culture as a part of it and not as a tourist. For now,
this is definitely something that I wanna keep doing.

So yeah, I've sold out a bit, but only because it'll make me better when I get back. And yes,
17 year old me would definitely have been happy with me.

# What's next?
I really have no idea. Graduation was a cold hard slog and I'm actually kinda okay with not having
big life plans for a couple of years. I plan to be a little financially responsible though, but let's
see how that goes.

# When are you gonna write the next post?
I'm gonna be more regular getting my thoughts in writing from now on. I think it could lead to
a really interesting personal experience later. Let's see how much of a sellout I am by the end of the year
and in ten years. I wanna say at least a minimum of a content post every month? If I don't have actual content,
I'll just do a rehash of these questions / think of better questions.

# What do you want to have done by the next month?
* Read a book, I'm looking at "An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management" by Will Larson right now.
* Release incremental dumps for [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org).
* Make statistics finally work for [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org).
* Feel comfortable writing Ruby and JavaScript.
