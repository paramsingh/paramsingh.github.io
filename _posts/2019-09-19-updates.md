I realized that I write a lot of diary-like update posts.

This is not something I actually regret, reading stuff about my life from years ago can actually be pretty fun.
But it's made the blog a bit cluttered and the posts I'm actually more proud of harder to find. So, for now, I've
moved those to a different section of the blog called the [diary](https://paramsingh.github.io/diary).

Also, such posts can be really interesting, so I'm gonna try to do weekly [5-15s](https://paramsingh.github.io/updates)
too as well. Hopefully, this makes me realize how to better utilize my weeks.

Also, I'm gonna try to think of more actual quality blog posts too, now that I can't wimp out with
diary style posts.
