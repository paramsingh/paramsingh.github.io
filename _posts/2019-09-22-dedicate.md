title: What do I do?
---

I watched [Ad Astra](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2935510/) today. It was a nice movie
about how instead of looking at the stars and space for answers, we should maybe be looking
in.

But that's not the point of this post. There was a moment in the movie that made me think.
Brad Pitt is sending a message to his long lost father and a sentence in the message
really stood out to me.

_"I've dedicated my life to the exploration of space"_

Personally, I cannot define what I wannt dedicate my life to... This is a problem. I do not
want to think of myself as having done nothing of note five years in the future. A job
at Stripe is a really amazing thing to have right now, but I'd be really disappointed if it was
my life's work product.

I don't know what I need from myself right now. I know that Stripe is the biggest learning
opportunity I've ever had in my life and I need to make the most of it as long as I can / need.
However, my MetaBrainz work is the work I'm really proud of. I need to stop procrastinating
and start working more on that too. However, most importantly, I need to find out what'll
make me feel proud of *my* work in life.

So yes, today made me realize that I need to think more about stuff I need to do before
I turn complacent. I think this realization was actually pretty important, and I'm thankful
that it doesn't seem to have come too late.
