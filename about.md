I'm Param Singh, a software developer for the [MetaBrainz Foundation](https://metabrainz.org/),
working on cool open-source music technology projects like [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org),
[AcousticBrainz](https://acousticbrainz.org) and [CritiqueBrainz](https://critiquebrainz.org).
. I am interested in music technology, algorithm development,
mathematical computing and competitive programming.
I love solving problems, be they algorithmic or mathematical.
When not staring at a screen, I play some chess and listen to music.

I also (try to) take (good) [photos](https://instagram.com/iliekcomputers).
