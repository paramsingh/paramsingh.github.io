I'm Param Singh, a third year Computer Science student at the National
Institute of Technology, Hamirpur. I am interested in algorithm development,
artificial intelligence, mathematical computing and competitive programming.
I love solving problems, be they algorithmic or mathematical. I also
contribute code to open source, specifically the
[ListenBrainz](https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server) project
of the [MetaBrainz Foundation](https://metabrainz.org/).

When not staring at a screen, I play some chess and listen to music.
