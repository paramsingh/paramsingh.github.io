    I fell in love with computers when I installed Ubuntu on my PC. I was 16 years old then. It changed my entire life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then, I've been making computers do weird things almost every day.
    First, I did a Masters and a Bachelors degree in Computer Science via a 5-year dual-degree progam from the <a href="https://nith.ac.in">National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, India</a>.
    During this time, I was also employed by <a href="https://metabrainz.org">MetaBrainz</a> as a Software Engineer.
    I was the lead developer of the <a href="https://listenbrainz.org">ListenBrainz</a> project.
  </p>
  <p>
    After graduating, I moved to Dublin and worked as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>.
    I worked on the Security team, where I learned a lot about how to programatically secure software that thousands of developers work on everyday.
  </p>
  <p>
    After 3 years and 7 months at Stripe, I moved back to India. I took a sabbatical for a while staying in Lucknow, working on a startup and building lots of projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    I moved to Bengaluru in February 2024, and came back to Stripe, working in the Infrastructure team this time.
