# What's going on?

_Posted: August 19, 2019_

_"What'd you do last year?" and other questions no one ever really asks themselves, but they should._

### Where have you been?
So a lot of things have happened since my last post. I've graduated (that was a slog!),
I've joined [Stripe](https://stripe.com), I've moved countries. It's been easier than I thought it'd be,
though.

### What are you doing these days?
I'm writing code while standing at a desk everyday, which I've found can be pretty
good for my productivity. I'm also trying to eat at as many different restaurants as possible.

### Have you sold out? (more positive take: Would 17 year old you be proud?)
One thing that I've realised (although I probably already knew this)
is that writing code for
a billion dollar corporation is definitely not as fulfilling as working with MetaBrainz
as a bunch of upstart hippies trying to change the music industry. I'm pretty sure right now
that a few years down the road, I'm gonna look at [MetaBrainz](https://metabrainz.org) as the shining light in my work, so
I really am trying to find time for it as much as possible.

However, the decision to move has definitely not been the wrong one, as far as I can see right now.
I'm learning new things, meeting more and more intelligent people pretty much every day, to say
nothing of the feeling of seeing a new culture as a part of it and not as a tourist. For now,
this is definitely something that I wanna keep doing.

So yeah, I've sold out a bit, but only because it'll make me better when I get back. And yes,
17 year old me would definitely have been happy with me.

### What's next?
I really have no idea. Graduation was a cold hard slog and I'm actually kinda okay with not having
big life plans for a couple of years. I plan to be a little financially responsible though, but let's
see how that goes.

### When are you gonna write the next post?
I'm gonna be more regular getting my thoughts in writing from now on. I think it could lead to
a really interesting personal experience later. Let's see how much of a sellout I am by the end of the year
and in ten years. I wanna say at least a minimum of a content post every month? If I don't have actual content,
I'll just do a rehash of these questions / think of better questions.

### What do you want to have done by the next month?
* Read a book, I'm looking at "An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management" by Will Larson right now.
* Release incremental dumps for [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org).
* Make statistics finally work for [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org).
* Feel comfortable writing Ruby and JavaScript.

# What did you do last semester? Travel.

_Posted: October 30, 2018_

_How I learned to stop worrying and love the airport_

I visited Barcelona, Paris and San Francisco in the last month.

It meant spending a major part of my time in airports around the world
and in the air.

It was still really fun!

There was a small landslide that almost cancelled all my plans of
doing cool things and meeting cool people in the MetaBrainz Summit 2018.
But I eventually made it to Barcelona. (phew!)

Barcelona is the best city I have ever visited. I gazed at the beauty of
the Sagrada Familia, gorged great food and great wine at the
Cuines Santa Caterina and drank myself silly at a BBQ on a terrace looking
over the beautiful city.

I also did a bunch of work in Barcelona, before eventually flying to Paris!

Paris had always been the "City of Love" to me. I was excited to actually
see it in real life with my own eyes. The first impression that I got was
that it was unreasonably chilly though. That went away soon as I got accustomed
to the weather and started doing some sightseeing. The Eiffel Tower,
the Louvre Museum, walking alongside the Seine, the Shakespeare and Company
bookstore, Paris definitely is a place to sightsee.

Then, I went home, only to catch a long flight to San Francisco two days later.

The Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit 2018 was the thing that brought me
to San Francisco.

San Francisco is crazy. I was exasperated when I realized that people
actually commute from San Francisco to places like Menlo Park and Mountain
View. Seems like a long trip to do everyday. But you get to work on cool
stuff and get paid to do it, so it might be worth it.

Anyways, I stayed in a crazy good hotel in San Francisco, and met some
really really really awesome people there. It really tripped my sensibilities
to meet so many people working on so much cool stuff in 3 days. It was crazy!

Crazy is really the only word I have to describe the last month of travels.
I feel pretty lucky to have been able to go to so many places while in college.

Anyways, I've become accustomed to airports definitely, with so many layovers
and so much waiting.

# Random Online Diary Update

_Posted: June 30, 2018_

It's been a long time since I updated the blog. When I wrote the last post,
I was in my mausi's house waiting to go to Barcelona for the MetaBrainz summit,
happy with getting my first real job. I'd also scored a shiny CodeNation
internship for the summer just a few weeks earlier.

Anyways, it's been almost 9 months since then and a lot of things have
happened. I'm still working for MetaBrainz, the cool projects are still cool.
I wasn't able to join CodeNation over the summer because of some really
weird issues with college. I'm not very disappointed because I like the
MetaBrainz work still.

I was a Google Code-In mentor this year, and I was impressed by all these young
kids knowing soo much when I, at their age, didn't know what a database was. It
has been really eye-opening, I tried to help as many people out as possible.

I'm now a Google Summer of Code mentor. I'm mentoring Rashi and comentoring Kartikeya,
both good friends and working on AcousticBrainz and MessyBrainz in the process.
Never would have thought of such a chain of events happening last GSoC,
when I was happy and content just getting into GSoC as a student.
Mentoring is pretty different, but I think we're making
progress and learning things (maybe different things but still things) together
which means that I'm happy with the projects.

Of course, mentoring GSoC is not the only thing in my GSoC responsibilites. I've
been working on ListenBrainz over the last months and we've had releases adding
big features. I worked on creating data dumps for ListenBrainz, that took a lot of
time. I worked on creating a recommendation engine (!!) with Suyash, that was
an awesome project. This summer has been work on importing listens from Spotify
automatically.

That's it for Computer Sciency stuff, I guess.

Other than that, I went to Thailand for a vacation in January! It has to be the
best trip I've ever made. Getting weirdly drunk and talking with a South African
tourist about cricket is a memory I won't forget.

I also went on a trip to the Andamans this summer. The weather tried to play
spoilsport but we had fun. We stayed in a hut with no internet and no phone
connectivity for a week. The beaches on Havelock Island are wonderful, I
would definitely consider them as one of the best.

I've been sitting at home now for almost a month, so I'm itching to go away
somewhere again. College starts in about 20 days, so I'm planning to visit
my brother in Kota, then visit friends in Jaipur and Mumbai and Delhi. I wonder
how tiring 4 cities in 15 days will be, we'll see.

Speaking of college, I'm stuck there for another year while friends who were
basically family are moving away to different corners of the globe. This made
me sad for a while. I'm not sure how time will pass without these people in college.
It won't be the same, that's for sure. I still have really really great people
in my life though, so I'm optimistic. âœ¨

# Some Really Eventful Weeks

_Posted: September 24, 2018_

The last few weeks of my life have been, for the lack of words, fast-paced and busy as fuck.

I'm currently sitting in a bed in my aunt's house with sleep nowhere to be found. This small moment
of peace has been something I've not had in as long as I can remember. I'm gonna
get on a flight to Barcelona tomorrow to meet some amazing MetaBrainz Foundation people for
the [MetaBrainz summit](https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/MusicBrainz_Summit/17) and this moment will
go away again. So I've decided to document stuff that's happened in my life since Summer of Code
started. Maybe I'll read this and look back at this time of my college career (reminiscing or some shit).

So I worked with great people in the MetaBrainz Foundation on ListenBrainz, my first "real" project.
The ListenBrainz beta was released this July, I was pretty overwhelmed when I saw code that I had
written being used by [over 800 users](https://listenbrainz.org/current-status). But Summer of Code
ended soon after and I had to acclimate back to college life, where nothing of note ever happens unless
you do something yourself.

I kept contributing to ListenBrainz as time went on, adding an API so that submissions
from Spotify to Last.FM could be redirected to LB and we'd understand those submissions. Also, I kept
fixing minor bugs as they popped along. I got an offer to join the MetaBrainz Foundation as a part-time
developer working on ListenBrainz and the MetaBrainz website (https://metabrainz.org). This was a nice
opportunity that I welcomed because college can get boring really rapidly and solving real problems is
a nice experience. Also, I'd always had an aim I was working towards during the majority of college (ACM-ICPC
in second year and the first half of third year and then GSoC in the second half of third year). MeB
would provide me with stuff to keep me productive and not go down the dark drain of doing nothing for
an year.

I ran around to Chandigarh in the meanwhile, applying to acquire a visa so that I could actually
attend the summit. This was a really taxing task, with tons and tons of paperwork. However, in
Chandigarh, I met [Pranav Kant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranvk/) and
[Sagar Karira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagar-karira-0b354162/) for dinner, awesome people who
made the trip a bit less tiring.

Meanwhile, I came across [CodeAgon](https://www.hackerrank.com/codeagon), a contest organized by
CodeNation, used by them for hiring interns and full-time engineers. To me, CodeNation always seemed
like this unassailable target, people like [Pranet Verma](http://spoj.com/users/pranet) and
[Lalit Kundu](http://codeforces.com/profile/darkshadows) work (or have worked) there. If a company has
options like these in their hiring processes, my chances seem slim at best and non-existent at worst.
I hadn't even taken part in a programming contest seriously since ACM-ICPC last year!

But anyways I decided to give it a try and got a rank of 137 in the contest, which was good
enough to be called for interviews. I got an e-mail asking if I was okay with giving an interview
on the day mid-semester exams had started. I replied back asking for the interview to take place on
the Tuesday after the week that midsems ended, because Sunday was Software Freedom Day celebrations (which
I had taken a major part in organizing) and then I had to go to Chandigarh again to collect my passport
on Monday.

I spent the midsemesters flip-flopping between interview prep (a bunch of leetcode grinding and GeeksForGeeks
and CTCI reading), studying for midsemesters and working on ListenBrainz. Because I was juggling around three
different things, I think I didn't do any of them really well. But the midsemester week got really
stressful because of this. But it ended somehow and I spent the next day running around trying to make
Software Freedom Day the best experience for everyone. The next day, I spent 12 hours traveling to and fro
from Chandigarh to collect my passport. (they granted me the visa!).

I was kinda tired the next day, but there was a CodeNation interview to give and I was really pessimistic.
I'd actually written a draft turning down the interview at one point. But I decided to go on and just
give it. The interview was pretty laid back, to be honest, just some cool discussion on the
stuff I'd worked on so far. There was a lot of talk about LB, the tech decisions we'd made and
the challenges I'd faced in GSoC. I got to the second round, but I also had a presentation to give the next
day on my major project.

This meant juggling around interview prep and my major team. At this point, I was pretty fed up and
tired. It felt like I'd been working 80 hour weeks for the last three weeks and when the major project
presentation ended, I decided to just sleep
and not worry about the interview. I woke up 5 minutes before the interview. This round was the one in
which I was gonna have to write actual code, so I wasn't sure how well it would go, tbh. It was pretty
stressful for me, trying to grope around for solutions to two problems (one easy and one kinda hard)
while trying to make sure the interviewer was on the same page as me and he knew my thought process.
I got to the solution of the first problem somehow, but it took me much longer than it normally would
(mostly because I wasn't even sitting with a notebook and pen). I wrote the code pretty fast though.
The second problem was harder and I got to the optimal solution after getting a LOT of hints. There
was no time to actually code it up though.

When the interview ended, I thought I had messed it up beyond repair and there was no way I'd move
forward to the next round. (it was kinda bittersweet because if I didn't, at least my busy weeks would
come to an end.) But then a mail came, telling me that I'd made it and the next (final) round would take
place the next day. I didn't study much for this round, reading last minute notes for Operating Systems
and DBMS (just in case).

The last round was pretty cool, a system design round, where I was asked to design a service like
Spotify and Google Play Music. I decided what features I wanted to add and how I'd add them. We focussed
on a Shazam like audio fingerprinting feature for the major part of the interview. This was kinda hard for
me because I have literally no machine learning experience, so I kept talking about my own weird ways
of matching recorded data with actual real data to find the correct track being played. The most fun part
of the interview was the last 10 minutes when I was asked to brainstorm as many features we could add to
this service as possible. I spewed out so many features in this small time, I kinda surprised myself.

The next day, I got an offer! Now, stuff has returned to normal, I guess. I'm not that busy anymore (for now).

I plan on making the summit a nice cooldown affair to get back to normal life. Hopefully, the long
weeks are now over.
