*I do weekly updates every Sunday on this page. They should ideally take me 15 minutes to write and if a person reads them, it should take them 5 minutes, not that I expect anyone to read them.*

* This week was interesting because I was able to collaborate with the design team
on some cool stuff. It's really interesting to see the thought process of design
people in contrast to software engineers. There's more of an emphasis on "what"
instead of "how", I think.
* Stripe also really focuses on user feedback. I got some insight into user
interviews and how they're done here at Stripe. I'm hoping to do an actual user
interview next week.
* MetaBrainz was a bit light this week. I upgraded Python on listenbrainz-labs,
merged a few PRs, made some progress on jobs on the spark cluster, but I wasn't
able to spend much time on this.
* I got the Irish visa this week! I'm gonna get to Dublin soon!
* Personal stuff: Encountered some racism when walking down the street this week.
Also, this was a good week for general media consumption. I started reading
"Me Before You", finished a re-watch of "Friends", watched "Ad Astra" in IMAX
and started "Your Lie in April".

* I spend a lot of time learning stuff at Stripe. Been working with Ruby
and React a lot which is fun, however working basically remotely with a
7 hour time difference isn't really the most ideal experience. I haven't
been able to take on the *really* challenging tasks because I can't
really pair with anyone on those logistically.
* On that note, to keep learning, I've been reading up a lot of documentation
at Stripe. I read a lot of stuff about Stripe's [major downtime](https://stripe.com/rcas/2019-07-10)
in July 2019. Also, been reading 5-15s of cool people working there.
* On the MetaBrainz front, I did some code review for Vansika's code in listenbrainz-labs,
I also worked on some security upgrades that dependabot couldn't grok for some reason.
Also, I looked into upgrading python for listenbrainz-labs, we were still running Python 3.4
which wasn't ideal.
* Personal stuff: I went to my first ever concert! Bon Iver at the Chase Center. The performance
of Woods at the end blew my mind.
