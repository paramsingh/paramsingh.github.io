*I do weekly updates every Sunday on this page. They should ideally take me 15 minutes to write and if a person reads them, it should take them 5 minutes, not that I expect anyone to read them.*

# 15th September, 2019

* I spend a lot of time learning stuff at Stripe. Been working with Ruby
and React a lot which is fun, however working basically remotely with a
7 hour time difference isn't really the most ideal experience. I haven't
been able to take on the *really* challenging tasks because I can't
really pair with anyone on those logistically.
* On that note, to keep learning, I've been reading up a lot of documentation
at Stripe. I read a lot of stuff about Stripe's [major downtime](https://stripe.com/rcas/2019-07-10)
in July 2019. Also, been reading 5-15s of cool people working there.
* On the MetaBrainz front, I did some code review for Vansika's code in listenbrainz-labs,
I also worked on some security upgrades that dependabot couldn't grok for some reason.
Also, I looked into upgrading python for listenbrainz-labs, we were still running Python 3.4
which wasn't ideal.
* Personal stuff: I went to my first ever concert! Bon Iver at the Chase Center. The performance
of Woods at the end blew my mind.
