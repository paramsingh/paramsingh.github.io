"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 456","","The year you were born in—1917—was one of the memorable years of history when a great leader, with a heart full of love and sympathy for the poor and suffering, made his people write a noble and never-to-be-forgotten chapter of history. In the very month in which you were born, Lenin started the great Revolution which has changed the face of Russia and Siberia."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 554","","“For the family sacrifice the individual, for the community the family, for the country the community, and for the Soul the whole world”."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 617","","Size is the poorest test of a man’s or a country’s greatness."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 671","","But nowhere else, apart from India and China, has there been a real continuity of civilization."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 681","","they loved life and knew that the only way to enjoy life was to be fearless, and not to worry about defeat and disaster."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 702","","The Indian Aryans were influenced greatly by the still older civilization of India—that of the Dravidians, and perhaps the remains of the civilization whose ruins we see at Mohenjo Daro. The Aryans and the Dravidians gave much to each other and took much from each other also, and thus built up a common culture for India."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 713","","In the mainland of Greece famous cities grew up: Athens and Sparta and Thebes and Corinth. The early days of the Greeks, or the Hellenes as they were called, were celebrated in two famous epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. You know something about these two epics, which in a way correspond to our own epics, the Ramayana and Mahabharata."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 811","","It is that of Croesus of whom you must have heard. To be as rich as Croesus has become a well-known saying in English. You may also have read stories of this Croesus, of how rich and proud he was and how he was humbled. Croesus was the king of a country called Lydia, which was on the west coast of Asia, where Asia Minor is today. Being a country touching the sea, probably there was a great deal of trade there. In his time the Persian Empire under Cyrus was growing and becoming powerful. Cyrus and Croesus came into conflict and Cyrus defeated Croesus."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 858","","Rajatarangini,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 885","","It is likely to become the common language of India."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 947","","the Lichchhavi clan. This State was a republic, and was governed by an assembly of notables with an elected president, who was called the Nayaka."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1072","","By improving the method of getting food, by making it easier to get it, agriculture changed the whole basis of society. It gave people leisure."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1182","","our ideals should be wholly unselfish, so that we may try to live up to them."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1234","","those who are prepared to die for any cause are seldom defeated."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1282","","Herodotus thought over it and drew a moral from it. He says that a nation’s history has three stages: success; then as a consequence of success, arrogance and injustice; and then, as a consequence of these, downfall."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1313","","The power of Athens grew; and here is evidence—and there is proof of it everywhere—that liberty is a good thing. While the Athenians were despotically governed, they were not superior in war to any of their neighbours, but when they got rid of their despot, they far surpassed them. This shows that in subjection they did not exert themselves, but they were working for a master, but when they became free each individual keenly did his best on his own account."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1367","","In this book, the Shahnamah of Firdausi, it is interesting to find numerous references to Indian swords and daggers being used by the Persian King and nobles. This indicates that even in Alexander’s day India was making swords of fine steel, which were welcomed in foreign countries."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1445","","Kings are disappearing from this world of ours. There are very few left, and they too will go soon enough. It is interesting, however, to see that the idea of kingship in ancient India meant service of the people."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1713","","Takshashila or Taxila in the far north, near Peshawar; Mathura, vulgarly spelt Muttra now by the English; Ujjain in Central India; and Nalanda near Patna in Bihar"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1719","","Hospitals especially meant for them were erected, and animal-sacrifice was forbidden."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1736","","“All sects deserve reverence for one reason or another. By thus acting a man exalts his own sect and at the same time does service to the sects of other people.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1760","","after the death of Alexander his empire was divided up by his generals. There were three principal divisions: (1) Western Asia, Persia, and Mesopotamia, under Seleucus; (2) Egypt under Ptolemy; and (3) Macedonia, under Antigonus."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1767","","Alexandria was the capital of the Ptolemys in Egypt."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1790","","the Duke of Ch’in, managed to drive out the ancient and effete Chou dynasty. His descendants are called the Ch’in dynasty, and it is interesting to note that the name China is derived from this Ch’in."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1794","","His name was Wang Cheng, but later he adopted another name—Shih Huang Ti—and he is usually known by his second name, which means “The First Emperor”."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1811","","the great Ch’ins rose and triumphed and ruled a powerful empire, and decayed and ended—all in a brief fifty years. Shih Huang Ti was to have been the first of a great line of powerful emperors, and yet three years after his death in 209 BC, his dynasty came to an end. And soon, after all, the books and the classics of Confucius were dug out of hiding,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1816","","It was he who started building the Great Wall. This was an expensive job. But the Chinese apparently preferred spending money over this wall, which was to protect them from foreign enemies, to keeping a large standing army for defence. The Wall could hardly prevent a big invasion. All it did was to stop petty raids. It shows, however, that the Chinese wanted peace and, in spite of their strength, were not lovers of military glory."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1836","","The second noteworthy fact was the introduction of the examination system for public officials."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1891","","There were three wars between them—the Punic Wars they are called. The first Punic War lasted twenty-three years from 264 to 241 BC and ended in a victory for Rome. Twenty-two years later came the second Punic War, and Carthage sent a general, famous in history, named Hannibal. For fifteen years Hannibal harassed Rome and terrorized the Roman people."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1920","","Even the poor, down-trodden slaves rose in revolt under a gladiator named Spartacus. But they were crushed ruthlessly, and it is said that 6000 of them were crucified on the Appian Way in Rome."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2085","","Today the Mahayana form of Buddhism exists in China, Japan and Tibet; the Hinayana exists in Ceylon and Burma."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2131","","The Roman people were not intolerant so far as religions went, for the Empire tolerated all religions, and even if someone chose to blaspheme or curse any of the gods, he was not punished. As one of the emperors, Tiberius, said: “If the gods are insulted, let them see to it themselves.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2145","","They were hostile to all other religions and they refused absolutely to worship the Emperor’s image."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2147","","As a religion, they might have tolerated Christianity, but the Christian refusal to pay homage to the Emperor’s image was looked upon as political treason and was made punishable with death."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2161","","One party said that the word Homo-ousion should be used in a prayer; the other wanted Homoi-ousion—this difference had reference to the divinity of Jesus. Over this diphthong fierce war was raged and large numbers of people were slaughtered."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2243","","Three hundred years after Augustus Caesar, an emperor named Constantine took a great step which was to have far-reaching consequences. He actually shifted the seat of his empire from Rome to the East. Near an old city called Byzantium on the shores of the Bosphorus, between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, he founded a new city, which he called, after himself, Constantinople. Constantinople, or New Rome as it was also called, became then the capital and seat of the Roman Empire."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2377","","there is one other strong resemblance between the Romans and the English people—they are both singularly devoid of imagination!"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2466","","was this Pallava government that seems to have organized this colonization of Malaysia."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2541","","He tells us that the people of Magadha were happy and prosperous; that justice was mildly administered; and that there was no death penalty."
