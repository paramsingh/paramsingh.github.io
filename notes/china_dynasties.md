_(Incomplete, will fill in the blanks as I go)_

China has had a bunch of dynasties since the beginning of their civilization.

- Xia Dynasty -- Semi-mythological, no contemporary records.
- Shang Dynasty (1600 BC - ~1000 BC)
- Zhou Dynasty (~1000 ~ ~200 BC) -- longest dynasty in Chinese history, lasted ~800 years.
  - Western Zhou (~1000BC - 771 BC) -- more "virtuous", notable person is the Duke of Zhou, who served as regent for his nephew and didn't usurp.
  - Eastern Zhou (770 BC - ~250 BC) -- more "despotic", which is why people considered the Mandate of Heaven to be gone later.
- Qin Dynasty -- the dynasty of the First Emperor.
