* Written in three years by a Constituent Assembly consisting of 389 members.
* Assembly held 11 sessions, each session consumed 165 days.
* 82% of members of the Assembly were INC members.
* Went with [FPTP]({% link notes/first_past_the_post.md %}) for the electorate system. [STV]({% link notes/single_transferable_vote.md %}) was not seriously considered.
* There were controversies over Centre having too much power, for example, Article 356, which gave
the centre power to take over a state government on the recommendation of the governor.
* There were arguments for giving muslims a seperate electorate! Sardar Patel argued against this.
* There were also controversies about the national language of India. We use Hindi and English for official purposes and states use regional languages.
