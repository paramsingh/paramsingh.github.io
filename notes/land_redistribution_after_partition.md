title: Land redistribution in India after Partition
---

After the partition, there was around 1.9 million hectares of land in East
Punjab that had to be abandoned by people migrating to Pakistan. This was less than the
2.7 million hectares that had to be abandoned by people migrating from Pakiston to
India. The 1.9 million hectares of land was redistributed among refugees during
the [refugee crisis]({% link notes/refugee_crisis_after_partition.md %}). This is probably
one of the biggest land resettlement operation in world history.

* Each family got 4 hectares of land regardless of holdings in Pakistan.
* Sardar Tarlok Singh used the [Standard Acre]({% link notes/standard_acre.md %}) and
[Graded Cut]({% link notes/graded_cut.md %}) policies to try to fairly allocate land.
