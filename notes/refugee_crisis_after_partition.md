title: Indian refugee crisis after partition
---

* India had to deal with a pretty huge refugee problem after Partition in 1947.
* Around 300,000 people in a refugee camp in Kurukshetra.
* 500,000 refugees in Delhi
* 500,000 refugess in Bombay
* 1.7 million people migrated to West Bengal from East Pakistan in 1950.
* These people (most of them farmers) left their land behind and so needed
massive amounts of support from the Indian government.
