title: Single Transferable Vote
---

In the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system, voters rank candidates in their constituencies.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote),
each elector marks their ballot for the most preferred candidate and
also marks back-up preferences. The vote goes to the voter's first preference if possible,
but if their first preference is eliminated, instead of being thrown away,
the vote is transferred to a back-up preference, with the vote being assigned
to the voter's second, third, or lower choice or being apportioned
fractionally to different candidates.

This system is used currently in Ireland. Eamon De Valera however passed an
[amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_Bill_1958)
moving to [FPTP]({% link notes/first_past_the_post.md %}). There was a referendum
where STV won the vote 51% to 48%.
