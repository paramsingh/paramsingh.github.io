Since the land in Punjab being
[redistributed]({% link notes/land_redistribution_after_partition.md %}) to the
[refugees]({% link notes/refugee_crisis_after_partition.md %}) was arid in some places
and pretty fertile in others, equitable distribution to farmers was hard.


Sardar Tarlok Singh came up the Standard Acre concept to fix this. A 'standard acre'
was defined as the amount of land which could yield ten to eleven maunds of rice. In
the dry ares, one standard acre might be four physical acres.

This concept took care of the variations in soil and climate across the province during
redistribution.
